##### 404 page

- In Next.js, a **404 page** is the page that is displayed when a user tries to access a route that does not exist in your application. Next.js provides a built-in way to handle 404 errors. By default, if a route doesn't match any of the pages in your `pages/` directory, Next.js will display a default 404 page.



```
// src/app/not-found.tsx

export default function PageNotFound() {
  return (
    <div>404 page not found</div>
  );
}
```

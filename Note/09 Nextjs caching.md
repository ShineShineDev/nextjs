##### Caching



- In Next.js, caching refers to the strategy used to store and reuse data or rendered pages to improve performance and reduce load times. Next.js provides a few built-in caching mechanisms that help optimize both server-side and client-side performance. 
- Next.js caching is a combination of static, dynamic, and client-side strategies to deliver fast performance. By leveraging static site generation (SSG), incremental static regeneration (ISR), server-side rendering (SSR), and client-side caching, you can optimize your applicationâ€™s performance, reduce load times, and improve scalability.
